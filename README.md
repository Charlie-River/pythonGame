# pythonGame
This project was made 2 years ago (from the time of this commit)! Therefore I don't remember much about it :P apart from the fact that it took me a *very* long time and was *very* tedious!
Essentially, it's a choice-based game where the user needs to make their way through the haunted house, killing zombies and collecting items to ensure their safe escape. It was my first time using python which was super interesting, I'd like to use it a little more in the future.
